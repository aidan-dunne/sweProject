		<h2>Welcome - your job search starts here!</h2>
		<section id="homePageMain">
			<p>Whether you're looking for an internship that fits your skillset, an REU in a research area that interests you, or a company at which
			Truman students like you have had success at in the past, it can all be found here. </p>
			<h3>Resources</h3>
			<p>With our website, we aim to make the internship-searching process more accessible and less stressful for groups like
			international students and underclassmen who may have a difficult time finding internships that will consider their
			applications. Our internship database offers a range of easy-to-use search filters which will allow you to refine your internship search
			and more efficiently find internships that are perfect for you. Additionally, our (placeholder name) page provides a list of companies that 
			offer internship programs at which Truman students have been successful at in the past.</p>
			<p>Our Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) page offers an explanation of what REUs are, why you may want to consider one
			over an internship, and provides a link to the National Science Foundation's REU database.</p>
			<h3>Whatever it is you're looking for, we hope we can help you find it!</h3>
