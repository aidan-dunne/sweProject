		<h2>Why</h2>
		<section id="homePageMain">
			<p>REUs, or Research Experiences for Undergraduates, are programs funded by the NSF to help undergraduates
                become interested in the prospect of research. They're also, more importantly, <b>more likely to accept underclassmen</b>
                than traditional internships.
            </p>
			<h2>What</h2>
            <p>REUs are 10 week programs hosted at universities across the country. You're assigned a research advisor
                upon your acceptance, and that advisor has some kind of real-world project they'll guide you to work through, helping
                you learn whatever you need to know along the way. At the end of the program, you'll present your project and
                research. Along the way, you'll get to meet a lot of new people, explore a new campus, and do work not strictly
                limited to programming.
            </p>
            <h2>Where</h2>
            <p>REUs are hosted primarily at larger universities, but can theoretically happen anywhere. Larger universities
                tend to have larger programs, however.
            </p>
            <h2>How</h2>
            <p>Unlike internships, REUs already have a <a href=https://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/reu/list_result.jsp?unitid=5049>
            complete, usable database</a> to aid you in your search. We'd highly recommend checking it out if you're interested.</p>
