			<h2>Internships that Fit You</h2>
			<p>Our internship database contains a large variety of computer science internships and our website provides you many filters which we
			hope will allow you to effectively search for and find the internships most interesting to you and most applicable to your skill set.
			These filters will help you greatly refine your search based on whether internships are open to certain groups of students, where
			internships are located, whether internships are remote or in person, and various other critera. Each of our filters is explained in-depth 
			later in this page.</p>
